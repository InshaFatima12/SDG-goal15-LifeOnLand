<br>
The fifteen UN SDG 
<br>
<br>
Why?
<br>
Forests cover nearly 31percent of our planet’s land area. From the air we breathe, to the water we drink, to the food we eat–forests sustain us.Think about it. Around 1.6 billion people depend on forests for 
their livelihood.
Almost 75 percent of the world’s poor are affected directly by land degradation. Did you know that forests are home to more than 80 per cent of all terrestrial species of animals, plants and insects? And of the 8,300 animal breeds known, 8 per- cent are extinct and 22 per cent are at risk of extinction.
