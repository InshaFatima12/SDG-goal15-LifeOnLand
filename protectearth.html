What can we do?
<br>
<br>
Inevitably, we change 
the ecosystems we are a part of through our presence ,but we can make choices that either affirm diversity or 
devalue it. Some things we can do to help include recycling, eating a locally-based diet that is sustainably sourced,
 consuming only what we need, and limiting energy usage through efficient heating and cooling system.
<br>
<br>

By doing this we can assure a clean and green future for humans and animals!
<br>
<br>
Don't forget to do YOUR PART in protecting the environment! :)
