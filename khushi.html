<center><h2> How- terrestrial life- on Earth is being affected due to the climate-change[s]- caused by the careless nature of humans-</h2> <br><br>

The increasing pace of the emission of greenhouse gases- is reducing a lot of the remaining-carbon budget- left for human survival- and for few other terrestrial animal[s] as well-
The Earth’s climate has-been-warming rapidly- and at a comparatively higher rate than before- 
The constantly melting glaciers- the continuously increasing global-<br>
-temperatures- the massive-scale- destruction of the planet’s ecosystem- through deforestation- done due to the large-scale-industrialization in this era- and even- the polluted environment- have had a grave impact- on the terrestrial life- <br><br>

The increased heat, drought and insect outbreaks, all linked to climate change, have increased wildfires. Declining water supplies, reduced agricultural yields, health impacts in cities due to the heat, and flooding and erosion in coastal areas. Which affects terrestrial life and us humans.
The Arctic, Africa, small islands and Asian mega deltas are regions which are most likely to be affected by future climate change. Africa is one of the most vulnerable continents to climate variability and change because of multiple existing stresses and low adaptive capacity.
